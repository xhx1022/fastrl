FastRL is an open-source framework for high-efficiency reasoning RL training, powered by our system TLT (Taming the Long Tail), a new approach that eliminates the long-tail rollout bottleneck in reasoning LLMs through adaptive speculative decoding. With FastRL, you can train large reasoning models drastically faster, using lossless decoding, opportunistic drafter training, and adaptive SD scheduling.

## Releases 📰

<strong>[2025/11]</strong> TLT paper is released on arXiv: [Taming the Long Tail: Efficient Reinforcement Learning for Language Models via Adaptive Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16665)

## Key Features ✨
🧠 **Lossless On-Policy RL Training** 

+ FastRL preserves the exact behavior of the underlying RL algorithm by applying mathematically lossless speculative decoding that never alters rollout distributions. 

⚡ **Adaptive Rollout Engine** 

+ A dynamic speculative decoding pipeline that automatically enables/disables SD and selects optimal SD strategies accelerates long-tail rollouts. 

🔥 **Adaptive Drafter Training**

+ A lightweight single-layer drafter continuously aligned with the evolving target model via harvesting spare GPU resources, ensuring high acceptance rates.

## Getting Started 🎯

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone --recursive https://github.com/mit-han-lab/fastrl.git
conda create --name fastrl python=3.12
conda activate fastrl

# Install SGLang
cd third-party/sglang
pip install -e "python[all]"

# Install flash_attn
pip install https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention/releases/download/v2.8.3/flash_attn-2.8.3+cu12torch2.8cxx11abiTRUE-cp312-cp312-linux_x86_64.whl

# Install FastRL
pip install -e .
```


### Quick Start

#### Step 1: Model Preparation

For maximum acceleration, we recommend starting from an Eagle-trained model. You can train your own using the scripts in `eagle-train/`, or use our prepared models:

[🤗 Qwen2.5-7B-Eagle-RL](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/Qwen2.5-7B-Eagle-RL)

[🤗 Qwen2.5-32B-Eagle-RL](https://huggingface.co/mit-han-lab/Qwen2.5-32B-Eagle-RL)


#### Step 2: Speed Benchmark

Evaluate FastRL’s speculative decoding speedup on a sample dataset:

```bash
bash examples/bench_sd.sh
```
> [!NOTE]
> Eagle is very sensitive to the prefix. Ensure the prefix matches the RL training prefix for accurate benchmarks. A few tuning steps are sufficient for adaptation if needed.


#### Step 3: Model Preparation

We provide complete end-to-end scripts for 7B and 32B models, for both single-node and multi-node training.

Single-node training:
```bash
bash examples/grpo_7B.sh
```


Multi-node training (Slurm):
```bash
sbatch examples/grpo_32B_multi_nodes.sh
```

> [!NOTE]
> We observe that well-trained drafter maintains high acceptance lengths over many RL steps. We do not recommend updating it every step, as this may introduce occasional contention.
