It’s already 30 minutes past eleven!”\n\n“I’m so sorry, but actually I got lost. I have no idea where I am now at all and I got tired wandering around. Please help!”\n\n- Today you came to the metropolis to play with your friend. But she didn’t show up at the appointed time. What happened to her? After some uncomfortable minutes, finally you managed to get her on line, and have been just notified that she’s been lost in the city.\n\nYou immediately told her not to move, and asked her what are around her to figure out where she is. She told the names of some famous land marks, in the order where she caught in her sight while she made a full turn counterclockwise without moving around.\n\nFortunately, today you have a map of the city. You located all the land marks she answered on the map, but want to know in which district of the city she’s wandering.\n\nWrite a program to calculate the area where she can be found, as soon as you can!\n\n\n\nInput\n\nEach input case is given in the format below:\n\n\nN\nx1 y1\n...\nxN yN\nl1... lN\n\n\nAn integer N in the first line specifies the number of land marks she named (N ≤ 10). The following N lines specify the x- and y-coordinates of the land marks in the city. Here you modeled the city as an unbounded two- dimensional plane. All coordinate values are integers between 0 and 100, inclusive. The last line of a test case specifies the order in which she found these land marks in a counterclockwise turn.\n\nA single line containing zero indicates the end of input. This is not a part of the input and should not be processed.\n\nOutput\n\nYour program should output one line for each test case.\n\nThe line should contain the case number followed by a single number which represents the area where she can be found. The value should be printed with the fifth digit after the decimal point, and should not contain an absolute error greater than 10-5.\n\nIf there is no possible area found under the given condition, output “No area” in a line, instead of a number. If you cannot bound the area, output “Infinity”.\n\nExample\n\nInput\n\n8\n1 0\n2 0\n3 1\n3 2\n2 3\n1 3\n0 2\n0 1\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n8\n1 0\n2 0\n3 1\n3 2\n2 3\n1 3\n0 2\n0 1\n4 3 2 1 8 7 6 5\n4\n0 0\n1 0\n1 1\n0 1\n1 2 3 4\n0\n\n\nOutput\n\nCase 1: 10.00000\nCase 2: No area\nCase 3: Infinity\n\nWrite Python code to solve the problem.

They research the culture of the ancient tribes that used to inhabit the island many years ago.\n\nOverall they've dug out n villages. Some pairs of villages were connected by roads. People could go on the roads in both directions. Overall there were exactly n - 1 roads, and from any village one could get to any other one.\n\nThe tribes were not peaceful and they had many wars. As a result of the wars, some villages were destroyed completely. During more peaceful years some of the villages were restored.\n\nAt each moment of time people used only those roads that belonged to some shortest way between two villages that existed at the given moment. In other words, people used the minimum subset of roads in such a way, that it was possible to get from any existing village to any other existing one. Note that throughout the island's whole history, there existed exactly n - 1 roads that have been found by the researchers. There never were any other roads.\n\nThe researchers think that observing the total sum of used roads’ lengths at different moments of time can help to better understand the tribes' culture and answer several historical questions.\n\nYou will be given the full history of the tribes' existence. Your task is to determine the total length of used roads at some moments of time.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105) — the number of villages. The next n - 1 lines describe the roads. The i-th of these lines contains three integers ai, bi and ci (1 ≤ ai, bi ≤ n, ai ≠ bi, 1 ≤ ci ≤ 109, 1 ≤ i < n) — the numbers of villages that are connected by the i-th road and the road's length. The numbers in the lines are separated by a space.\n\nThe next line contains an integer q (1 ≤ q ≤ 105) — the number of queries. Then follow q queries, one per line, ordered by time. Each query belongs to one of three types:\n\n  * \"+ x\" — village number x is restored (1 ≤ x ≤ n). \n  * \"- x\" — village number x is destroyed (1 ≤ x ≤ n). \n  * \"?\" — the archaeologists want to know the total length of the roads which were used for that time period.\n\n\n\nIt is guaranteed that the queries do not contradict each other, that is, there won't be queries to destroy non-existing villages or restore the already existing ones. It is guaranteed that we have at least one query of type \"?\". It is also guaranteed that one can get from any village to any other one by the given roads.\n\nAt the initial moment of time no village is considered to exist.\n\nOutput\n\nFor each query of type \"?\" print the total length of used roads on a single line. You should print the answers to the queries in the order, in which they are given in the input.\n\nPlease do not use the %lld specifier to read or write 64-bit integers in С++. It is preferred to use cin, cout streams or the %I64d specifier.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n6\n1 2 1\n1 3 5\n4 1 7\n4 5 3\n6 4 2\n10\n+ 3\n+ 1\n?\n+ 6\n?\n+ 5\n?\n- 6\n- 3\n?\n\n\nOutput\n\n5\n14\n17\n10\n\nWrite Python code to solve the problem.

Each boy presented each girl some integer number of sweets (possibly zero). All boys are numbered with integers from $1$ to $n$ and all girls are numbered with integers from $1$ to $m$. For all $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ the minimal number of sweets, which $i$-th boy presented to some girl is equal to $b_i$ and for all $1 \\leq j \\leq m$ the maximal number of sweets, which $j$-th girl received from some boy is equal to $g_j$.\n\nMore formally, let $a_{i,j}$ be the number of sweets which the $i$-th boy give to the $j$-th girl. Then $b_i$ is equal exactly to the minimum among values $a_{i,1}, a_{i,2}, \\ldots, a_{i,m}$ and $g_j$ is equal exactly to the maximum among values $b_{1,j}, b_{2,j}, \\ldots, b_{n,j}$.\n\nYou are interested in the minimum total number of sweets that boys could present, so you need to minimize the sum of $a_{i,j}$ for all $(i,j)$ such that $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ and $1 \\leq j \\leq m$. You are given the numbers $b_1, \\ldots, b_n$ and $g_1, \\ldots, g_m$, determine this number. \n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$, separated with space — the number of boys and girls, respectively ($2 \\leq n, m \\leq 100\\,000$). The second line contains $n$ integers $b_1, \\ldots, b_n$, separated by spaces — $b_i$ is equal to the minimal number of sweets, which $i$-th boy presented to some girl ($0 \\leq b_i \\leq 10^8$). The third line contains $m$ integers $g_1, \\ldots, g_m$, separated by spaces — $g_j$ is equal to the maximal number of sweets, which $j$-th girl received from some boy ($0 \\leq g_j \\leq 10^8$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf the described situation is impossible, print $-1$. In another case, print the minimal total number of sweets, which boys could have presented and all conditions could have satisfied.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n1 2 1\n3 4\n\nOutput\n12\nInput\n2 2\n0 1\n1 0\n\nOutput\n-1\nInput\n2 3\n1 0\n1 1 2\n\nOutput\n4\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first test, the minimal total number of sweets, which boys could have presented is equal to $12$. This can be possible, for example, if the first boy presented $1$ and $4$ sweets, the second boy presented $3$ and $2$ sweets and the third boy presented $1$ and $1$ sweets for the first and the second girl, respectively. It's easy to see, that all conditions are satisfied and the total number of sweets is equal to $12$.\n\nIn the second test, the boys couldn't have presented sweets in such way, that all statements satisfied.\n\nIn the third test, the minimal total number of sweets, which boys could have presented is equal to $4$. This can be possible, for example, if the first boy presented $1$, $1$, $2$ sweets for the first, second, third girl, respectively and the second boy didn't present sweets for each girl. It's easy to see, that all conditions are satisfied and the total number of sweets is equal to $4$.\n\nWrite Python code to solve the problem.
